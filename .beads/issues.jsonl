{"id":"the-shed-roa","title":"Session Logging: Capture and Export Detailed Practice Data","description":"## Executive Summary\n\nAdd comprehensive session logging to Piano Tutor that captures every MIDI event during practice sessions, enabling users to export and analyze their mistake patterns over time. This transforms ephemeral in-session stats into persistent, analyzable data.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Piano Tutor app currently shows in-session stats (round count, first-try %, mistakes) but doesn't persist detailed practice data. Users cannot analyze patterns in their mistakes over time or identify which specific challenges (chords, intervals, progressions) cause consistent trouble. \n\n**Current State:** Stats disappear after each session; no way to identify persistent weak areas.\n**Desired State:** Exportable practice data with keystroke-level detail for pattern analysis.\n\n## Phases\n\n1. Core Logging Infrastructure - Global state and lifecycle functions\n2. MIDI Handler Instrumentation - Capture every noteOn/noteOff with timing\n3. Mode Instrumentation - Hook all 20 practice modes into logging\n4. Header Toggle Button - Quick on/off toggle during practice\n5. Session Log Panel - Management interface for viewing/exporting data\n6. JSON Export - Full structured data export\n7. CSV Export Functions - Summary and detailed CSV formats\n8. Storage Management - 100 session limit with export prompts\n9. Settings Persistence - Remember enabled state across reloads\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Can export practice data and identify which specific chord types/intervals have highest mistake rates\n- [ ] Data includes enough detail to see what wrong notes were played (not just \"you made a mistake\")\n- [ ] Logging works consistently across all 20 practice modes\n\n## Key Risks\n\n- Large codebase (single file ~13k lines) - work in focused sections\n- 20 modes to instrument - checklist approach, verify all covered\n- localStorage limits (~5MB) - 100 session cap with size monitoring\n- Performance impact - guard checks are fast, only record when enabled\n\n## Reference\n\nSpecification: thoughts/specs/2026-01-17-session-logging.md\nImplementation notes: docs/session-logging.md","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-17T12:01:01.921775136-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-17T12:01:01.921775136-08:00","created_by":"Wilfred Allyn"}
